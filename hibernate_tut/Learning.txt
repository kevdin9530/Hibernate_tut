 ////////////////////HIBERNATE/////////////////////
 Hibernate is a framework for persisting/saving Java object in database
 The benefit of hibernate is:
 - handles all of low-level SQL
 - Minimize the JDBC code need to develop 
 - it also provides Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)
 basically the developer need to define mapping between java class and database table
 
 - To save object with hibernate, we use a special hibernate object, hibernate will store data in the database.
 This allow u to skip writing the SQL code for inserting the data in database.
 - To retrieve a given object, just give an id to hibernate, it will query the table according to the given id.
 - To retrieve all java object instead of 1, basically u need to fetch a query from hibernate object from the
 given java class object, then use query.list() to fetch for full dataobject.
 - Hibernate CRUD Apps: Create/Read/Update/Delete objects
 
 Relationship between Hibernate n JDBC:
 - Hibernate use JDBC to communicate with the database. So Hibernate is just a layer of extraction of top of JDBC
 
 To start with Hibernate u need:
 - Java IDE
 - Database server
 - Hibernate JAR files and JDBC driver
